Prompt:
As a senior software developer I would like to take an software architect path so tell me the resources I need to learn to start a path like that. Consider books, web pages, blogs, online courses and youtube videos. Please include real cases I can develop on my own so I can get experience during the path training.

Answer:
Transitioning from a senior software developer to a software architect requires a deep understanding of architectural principles, design patterns, system scalability, and more. Here are some valuable resources to help you get started on your path to becoming a software architect:
