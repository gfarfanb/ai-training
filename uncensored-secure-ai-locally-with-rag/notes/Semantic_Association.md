| Prompt | What does Semantic Association means? |
| Answer | Semantic association refers to the relationship between words, phrases, or concepts and the meanings they evoke in the minds of speakers and listeners. This can encompass several aspects, including lexical association, collocational association, and more. It is a direct or indirect relation between two entities (words in this case) that is considered meaningful, and is useful in a certain context for an application. |
